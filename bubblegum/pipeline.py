    This class provides a wrapper layer of signals and slots

    to ring time.  The assumption that there will be one measurement
    (ex an area detector) which can not be interpolated and will serve
    as the source of reference time stamps.

    The language being used through out is that of pandas data frames.
    The data model is that of a sparse table keyed on time stamps which
    is 'densified' on demand by propagating the last measured value forward.
